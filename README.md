# Word Auto-Complete using NGram Model 
* Autocomplete, or word completion, is a feature in which an application predicts the rest of a word a user is typing. In graphical user interfaces, users can typically press the tab key to accept a suggestion or the down arrow key to accept one of several.
* Construct N_Gram word library using Map Reduce from Wikipedia corpus
* Built the language model based on frequency (use map reduce to count the frequency of 2-5 Grams)
* Stored the language model in MySQL database
* Web interface can connect to the NGram model through the database
